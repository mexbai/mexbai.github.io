    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
    
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We are very pleased about your interest in our company. Data protection is of a
            particularly high priority for the management of mexb.ai. The use of the Internet pages of mexb.ai is
            possible without any indication of personal data. However, if a person concerned wants to use the special
            services of our company via chatbot, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing
            of personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis against such processing, we will generally obtain
            the consent of the data subject.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or
            telephone number of a person concerned, shall always be in line with the country-specific data protection
            regulations applicable to mexb.ai. By means of this data protection declaration, our company would like to
            inform the public about the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use, and process.
            Furthermore, data subjects are informed of their rights by means of this data protection declaration.</span>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">As the controller, mexb.ai has implemented numerous technical and organizational
            measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through the website and chatbot.
            Nevertheless, Internet-based data transmissions can always be vulnerable to security risks, so that absolute
            protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transmit personal data to us
            by alternative means, for example by telephone.</span></p>

    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The internet pages of mexb.ai use cookies. Cookies are text files which are filed and
            stored on a computer system via an Internet browser.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Numerous Internet pages and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called
            cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a string of characters by which
            Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored.
            This enables the visited Internet pages and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the person
            concerned from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific internet browser can be
            recognized and identified via the unique cookie ID.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Through the use of cookies, mexb.ai can provide the users of this website with more
            user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized for
            the user. Cookies enable us, as already mentioned, to recognize the users of our website. The purpose of
            this recognition is to make it easier for users to use our website. For example, the user of a website that
            uses cookies does not have to re-enter his or her access data each time he or she visits the website,
            because this is handled by the website and the cookie stored on the user&#39;s computer system. Another
            example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online store. The online store uses a cookie to remember the
            items that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time by
            means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of
            cookies. Furthermore, cookies that have already been set can be deleted at any time via an Internet browser
            or other software programs. This is possible in all common Internet browsers. If the data subject
            deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be
            fully usable.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">4. Collection of general data and information</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The website of mexb.ai collects a series of general data and information with each
            call-up of the website by a person concerned or an automated system. This general data and information is
            stored in the log files of the server. The following data may be collected: (1) the browser types and
            versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an
            accessing system accesses our website (so-called referrer), (4) the sub-websites that are accessed via an
            accessing system on our website, (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6) an Internet protocol
            address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) other similar data
            and information that serve to avert danger in the event of attacks on our information technology
            systems.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">When using this general data and information, mexb.ai does not draw any conclusions
            about the person concerned. Rather, this information is needed (1) to deliver the contents of our website
            correctly, (2) to optimize the contents of our website and the advertising for these, (3) to ensure the
            long-term functionality of our information technology systems and the technology of our website, and (4) to
            provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for prosecution in the event of a cyber
            attack. Therefore, mexb.ai analyzes anonymously collected data and information on one hand, and on the other
            hand, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, to ensure an
            optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are
            stored separately from any personal data submitted by a person concerned.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">5. Where we store your personal data</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The personal data we collect from you is stored within the European Union on Oracle
            Data Cloud. Sensitive data is transmitted between your browser and our website in encrypted form. Transport
            Layer Security (&quot;TLS&quot;) is used for this purpose. When transmitting sensitive data, you should
            always make sure that your browser can check our certificate.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">6. Registration on the chatbot</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The person concerned has the possibility to register in the chatbot of the controller
            by providing personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller in the process results
            from the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by the person concerned
            is collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller and for the controller&#39;s own
            purposes. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The controller shall provide any data subject at any time, upon request, with
            information on which personal data concerning the person concerned are stored. Furthermore, the controller
            shall correct or delete personal data at the request or indication of the person concerned, insofar as this
            does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations. The entire staff of the controller shall be
            available to the person concerned as contact persons in this context.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">7. Legal basis for the data processing</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The legal basis for processing the data is the legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6
            (1) lit. f DSGVO. The legitimate interest is the secure provision of the website requested by the users. In
            addition, the purposes listed below also represent our legitimate interests.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">8. Legal basis of processing</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Art. 6 I lit. a DS-GVO serves our company as the legal basis for processing
            operations in which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data
            is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for
            example, with processing operations that are necessary for a delivery of goods or the provision of another
            service or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b DS-GVO. The same applies to such
            processing operations that are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for example in
            cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which
            a processing of personal data becomes necessary, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the
            processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c DS-GVO. In rare cases, the processing of personal data might become
            necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case,
            for example, if a visitor were to be injured on our premises and as a result his or her name, age, health
            insurance data or other vital information had to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.
            Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d DS-GVO. Finally, processing operations could be based
            on Art. 6 I lit. f DS-GVO. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal
            bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our
            company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
            are not overridden. Such processing operations are permitted to us in particular because they were
            specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, it took the view that a legitimate
            interest could be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the controller (recital 47 sentence 2
            DS-GVO).</span></p>

            concerning him or her, where one of the following grounds applies and insofar as the processing is no longer
            necessary: the personal data were collected or otherwise processed for such purposes for which they are no
            longer necessary. The person concerned revokes his or her consent on which the processing was based pursuant
            to Art. 6(1)(a) DS-GVO or Art. 9(2)(a) DS-GVO and there is no other legal basis for the processing. The
            person concerned objects to the processing pursuant to Art. 21(1) DS-GVO and there are no overriding
            legitimate grounds for the processing, or the person concerned objects to the processing pursuant to Art.
            21(2) DS-GVO. The personal data have been processed unlawfully. The erasure of the personal data is
            necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller is
            subject. The personal data has been collected in relation to information society services offered pursuant
            to Article 8(1) of the GDPR.</span></p>

            employee of the controller. The employee of mexb.ai shall arrange for the deletion request to be complied
            with immediately. If the personal data has been made public by mexb.ai and our enterprise as the controller
            is obliged to delete the personal data pursuant to Article 17 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, mexb.ai
            shall implement reasonable measures, including technical measures, taking into account the available
            technology and the costs of implementation, in order to inform other data controllers which process the
            published personal data that the person concerned has requested from those other data controllers to erase
            all links to or copies or replications of the personal data unless the processing is necessary. The employee

            European Directives and Regulations, to obtain from the controller the restriction of processing where one
            of the following conditions is met:</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the person concerned, for a period
            enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The processing is unlawful, the person concerned objects to the erasure of the
            personal data and requests instead the restriction of the use of the personal data.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but
            the person concerned needs them for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The data subject has objected to the processing pursuant to Article 21 (1) of the

            subject.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request
            the restriction of personal data stored by the mexb.ai, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of
            the controller. The employee of the mexb.ai will arrange the restriction of the processing.</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">f) Right to data portability</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p>

            European Directive and Regulation to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which have been
            provided by the person concerned to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
            format. He or she also has the right to transmit this data to another controller without hindrance from the
            controller to whom the personal data have been provided, provided that the processing is based on consent
            pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Article
            6(1)(b) of the GDPR and the processing is carried out by automated means, unless the processing is necessary
            for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
            vested in the controller. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Furthermore, when exercising the right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1)
            of the GDPR, the person concerned has the right to obtain that the personal data be transferred directly
            from one controller to another controller, where technically feasible and provided that this does not
            adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other persons.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">In order to assert the right to data portability, the person concerned may at any

            to provide us with personal data that must subsequently be processed by us. For example, the person
            concerned is obliged to provide us with personal data if our company concludes a contract with him or her.
            Failure to provide the personal data would mean that the contract with the data subject could not be
            concluded. Before providing personal data by the data subject, the data subject must contact one of our
            employees. Our employee will explain to the data subject on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of
            the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether
            there is an obligation to provide the personal data, and what the consequences of not providing the personal
            data would be. </span></p>
